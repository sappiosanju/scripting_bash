 History of Bash

 What is a SHELL?
 Command line interpreters 

  Operating System   			|		SHELL
   DOS		     			|		Command.com
   Windows 3.1/Windows NT		|		Program Manager	
   Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP/7	|		Windows Explorer

  IN 1971 first UNIX shell called as V6 shell by Ken thompson from Bell labs

  SHELL as a simple program that executes from outside of the kernel 
  
  strace and ltrace
  TLB (Transaction Lookaside Buffer) -- Hardware componenet present inside the CPU 

  2^operating system bit == address spaces 
  address space is used to get the mapping between the physical location to the virtual address in RAM 

  In 1977, the Bourne Shell was introduced by Stephen Bourne 

  The Bourne shell was designed to support interactive execution of commands for the operating system 
  Birth of scripting 

  Ksh zsh csh 

  BASH (the Bourne Again SHell)
  ------------------------------
  open source GNU project 
  * objective -- replace th Bourne SHELL
  * Developed by Brian Fox 
  * Standardize the SHELL environment 
  * Incorporate all functionalities from other shells like csh, ksh, zsh, etc
  * Added functionalities like defining functions, usage of regular expressions, working with associative arrays 
  * Released under GPL 

  UNIX SHELL (/bin/sh) 
 
  Core Concepts
  ===============
  Objective
  * Core bash configuration files
  * Bash environment & Bash environment variables
  * File as a bash script
  * Exit status 
  * pipes and redirections


  Core bash configuration files
  ==============================
  System-wide configuration -- /etc/profile, /etc/bashrc 

  User-specific configuration -- ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_history, ~/.bash_logout


  ~/.bash_profile 
  ---------------
  Purpose -- is designed to work only when we login and helps us to configure the shell environment 

  Whenever user is connected using the network services, then the ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc and preference will be given to ~/.bashrc file settings (runtime configuration)
  Whenever user is connected to the terminal directly, then ~/.bash_profile is read and if ~/.bashrc 
  
   ~/.bashrc
   ----------
   Purpose -- to serve runtime configurations 

   ~/.bash_history
   -----------------
   Purpose -- to store the locally executing command history 
   
   HISTCONTROL=ignoredups:ignorespace
   HISTSIZE
   HISTFILE

   ~/.bash_logout
   ---------------
   Purpose -- to define the house keeping tasks 
   
   export PS1="\[\e[32;40m\]\u\[\e[m\] \[\e[40m\]\w\[\e[m\] \A \[\e[32m\]#\[\e[m\] "
