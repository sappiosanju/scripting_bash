Objectives:
-----------
* Create a shell script
* Use Environment variables
* Using Variables
* Set and using system defined variables
* Comments Types and Structures
* Command substitution
* Exit status

Create a shell script
======================
* Make sure the script file has the execute permission bit set
* Do not require any extension
* Place the script on the appropriate executable PATH by defining the $PATH variable in ~/.bash_profile
* Follow the general standard by defining the SHEBANG and the interpreter information at the top. Followed by the Purpose, Created On, Maintained By informations

#!/bin/bash
# Purpose: Simple Script demo
# Created on: 10th Jan 2021
# Maintained by: Administrator
clear
echo "Hello World!!"

where #!  is known as SHEBANG
      and /bin/bash -- command interpreter

Running a script from vi environment is possible (but the file should be saved once)
:!<command>

Use Environment variables
============================
env or printenv -- global variables
set -- local variable to a shell

printenv has come from UNIX shell

Using Variables
==================
* Variables can be defined in lowercase or uppercase
* variable=value is the normal format without any space before and after = sign
* The variable is referred as $variable or ${variable}
* we can use the export command to export a variable with a static value

The script will run a separate subshell in which the variables are local 

Set and using system defined variables
========================================
Variable=VALUE
echo "My home directory is: $HOME"

Comments Types and Structures
================================
* Comments will always begins with a "#" symbol
* we dont have any grouping comments option
